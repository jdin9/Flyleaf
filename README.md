# Flyleaf

Prototype web application scaffold for designing coordinated book-spine covers.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

3. Lint the project:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/app` – Next.js App Router entry points and global styles.
- `public` – Static assets such as the Flyleaf logo.
- `docs` – Planning documents outlining the designer experience.

The landing page summarises stakeholder decisions so we can now focus on the interactive
customer designer, geometry utilities, and validation flows described in the docs.
